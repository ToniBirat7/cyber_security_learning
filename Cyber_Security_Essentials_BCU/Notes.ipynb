    "\n",
    "### **Social Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Social engineering is a non-technical strategy that attempts to manipulate individuals into performing certain actions or divulging confidential information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than software or hardware vulnerabilities, social engineering exploits human nature, taking advantage of people’s willingness to help or preying on their weaknesses, such as greed or vanity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pretexting**\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of attack occurs when an individual lies to gain access to privileged data. For example, an attacker pretends to need personal or financial data in order to confirm a person’s identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Something for something (quid pro quo)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quid pro quo attacks involve a request for personal information in exchange for something, like a gift. For example, a malicious email could ask you to give your sensitive personal details in exchange for a free vacation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identity fraud**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the use of a person’s stolen identity to obtain goods or services by deception. For example, someone has acquired your data and is attempting to issue a credit card in your name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Forms of Deception**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shoulder Surfing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Shoulder surfing is a simple attack that involves observing or literally looking over a target’s shoulder to gain valuable information such as PINs, access codes or credit card details. Criminals do not always have to be near their victim to shoulder surf — they can use binoculars or security cameras to obtain this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one reason why an ATM screen can only be viewed at certain angles. These types of safeguards make shoulder surfing much more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dumpster Diving**\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard of the phrase, ‘one man's trash is another man's treasure.’ Nowhere is this more true than in the world of dumpster diving — the process of going through a target's trash to see what information has been thrown out. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why documents containing sensitive information should be shredded or stored in burn bags until they are destroyed by fire after a certain period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Impersonation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hoaxes**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Piggybacking or Tailgating**\n",
    "\n",
    "Piggybacking or tailgating occurs when a criminal follows an authorized person to gain physical entry into a secure location or a restricted area. Criminals can achieve this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Giving the appearance of being escorted into the facility by an authorized person.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Joining and pretending to be part of a large crowd that enters the facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Targeting an authorized person who is careless about the rules of the facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of preventing this is to use two sets of doors. This is sometimes referred to as a mantrap and means individuals enter through an outer door, which must close before they can gain access through an inner door."

    "\n",
    "Layer 2 refers to the data link layer in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) data communication model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer is used to move data across a linked physical network. IP addresses are mapped to each physical device address (also known as media access control (MAC) address) on the network, using a procedure called address resolution protocol (ARP). \n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest terms, the MAC address identifies the intended receiver of an IP address sent over the network, and ARP resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses for transmitting data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Attackers often take advantage of vulnerabilities in this layer 2 security.\n",
