    " - Uses a key pair, one for `enc` and `desc`. The keys are termed as `Public Key` and `Private Key`. They `Public Key` is used for the `Encryption` and `Private Key` is used for `Descryption`.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `Public Key` is distributed publicly but should never leak the `Private Key`.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Every user in the network has their own set of key pairs. \n",

    " - `Asymmetric` relies on mathematical receipe know as `Trapdoor Functions` that uses very large `Prime Numbers`.\n",

    "As it uses only `Prime Numbers` for calulation, the multiplication or any arithmetic operation between any large `Prime Numbers` can be done easy but finding the exact factors that resulted the number is very difficult. Therefore, `Trapdoor Function` is best for `Encryption` and `Decryption`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Example, `P1*P2 = N` i.e. `5077*3089 = 15682853`. There might be many factors associated with the `N` but finding the exact ones which resulted `N` is very resourceful and time consuming. \n",

    "First, both the users will generate their `Key Pair`. Then there will be the exchange of `Public Keys` between the users. The `Public Key` is transmitted publicly.\n",

    "Then, the `Sender` `Encrypts` the `Plain Text` message with the `Public Key` of `Receriver`. Then the `Encrypted` messsage i.e. `Cipher Text` is send to the `Receiver` via the internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with the help of `Private Key` of the `Receiver` the message is `Decrypted` into the original `Plain Text` that was sent. \n",

    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "With this strategy we are now able to maintain the `PAIN` i.e. `P => Privacy`, `A => Aunthenticity`, `I => Integrity` and `N => Non-Repudiation`. Even if the hacker steals the `Public Key` he\\she won't be able to `Decrypt` because the `Private Keys` were never shared. \n",

Therefore, `Sender` will have all together two keys i.e. `Receiver's Public Key` and `Symmetric Key` and `Receiver` will have three key's i.e `Sender's Symmetric Key`, `Receiver's Private Key` and `Receiver's Public Key`.  \n",

    "Till now, `Asymmetric` has been able to maintain only 3 Security Goals i.e. `PAIN` or `CAIN`. We are left to do with `Integrity` i.e. how can we be sure that the received message was the acutal message that was sent by the `Sender`. For this we will use `Hashing`."
