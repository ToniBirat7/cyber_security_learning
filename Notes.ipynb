But, the `Hashing` should generate the same output for the same input each time (So that we can compare the hash and find if the data has lost it's `Integrity` or not). Even if there's small change in the `Input` the `Hash` of the input would be completely different.\n",

    "`Hashing` is used to store sensitive infos for example, `password`. `Hash` of the given password is saved into the database for that particular user.

A `CA` is voucing (Confirms) for the certificate's owner's identity in the same way as having a government issued `ID` such as `Passport`. There are many trusted third part organizations who acts as `CA`s i.e. `GlobalSign`, `Verisign`, `Entrust`, `GoDaddy`, `AWS`, `IdenTrust`, `DigiCert`. \n",

    "Suppose, Brian and Tasha are about to communicate with each other using `Asymmetric`. Firstly they exchange the `Public Keys` then `Brian` encrypts the message and sends it to `Tash`. `Tash` with her `Private Key` Decrypts the message. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, even if the hacker gets access to the shared `Public Key` via unsecured channels won't be able to create a damage becuase of `Private Key`. But, what if `Someone` was pretending to be `Tasha` and send `Public Key` that don't even belong to `Tasha`?? `Brian` only thought he was communicating to `Tash` the whole time. \n",

    "\n",
    "To create a `Digital Certificate` `Tash` will create new message called `Certified Signing Request` or `CSR` which contains her `Public Key`, `Name`, `Email Address` and `Other Identifying Infos`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This request gets forwarded to the `Registration Authority` or `RA`. The `RA` will take some of the adminstrative burden from the `CA` by verifying `Tasha's` infos. If the `RA` grants the request, `Tasha's` request is now passed to the `CA` to generate the `Digital Certificate`. If the provided infos are authenticated then `CA` will use its `Private Key` to place the `CA's` `Digital Signature` (Hash) on `Tasha's` `Digital Certificate`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, finally send it directly to `Tasha` to complete the process. The format she receives it in is known as `X509`, which is the international standard for `Digital Certificates`. \n",

    "Now, `Brian` can either have `Tasha` send her certificate over, or get it directly from the `CA`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, now when the `Encrypted` message is received by `Brian`, he trusts the `Certificate Authority` used by `Tasha`. Now, as `Brian` has the `Digital Certificate` that contains `Tasha's` specifics such as her `Public Keys`, `CA` specifics, and other `Cryptographic Data` that are required to identify `Tasha`. `Brian` uses the `CA's` `Public Key` to `Decrypt` and validate the certificate. Once the `Digital Certificate` is `Decypted`, \n",
    "\n",
    "`Brian` can now access the content inside it. `Brian` can now access `Tasha's` `Public Key` without tranfering over the unsecured channel. Then using the `Public Key` `Brian` decrypts the other messages. \n",

    "During this whole process, `Brain` got access to `Tasha's` `Public Key` and this time he had a way to validate that the `Public Key` came from `Tasha` by validating her `Digital Certificate`. "
